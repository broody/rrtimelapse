rrTimeLapse is an Android application for taking time lapse photography.

It supports various settings, such as resolution selection, start/stop timer or continuous shooting, amount of lapse time and auto focus selection.

It is designed to be able to work in the background, being undisturbed if the device is used for other activities (eg. receiving a call or alarm notification).
